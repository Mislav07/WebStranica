                    Phishing is a form of social engineering and a scam where attackers deceive people into 
                    revealing sensitive information[1] or installing malware such as viruses, worms, adware, 
                    or ransomware. <br> Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently 
                    mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim navigates 
                    the site, and transverses any additional security boundaries with the victim.[2] As of 2020, it is the 
                    most common type of cybercrime, with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center reporting more incidents 
                    of phishing than any other type of cybercrime.[3] <br>
